# ðŸ’§ HYDROWATCH-A WATER QUALITY MONITORING NETWORK FOR DRINKING AND IRRIGATION 

An interactive machine learning-based application for predicting water quality using various chemical parameters. This app supports both **classification** (predicting water quality class) and **regression** (predicting Water Quality Index - WQI) tasks using models like Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and more â€” all served through a **Gradio** interface.

## ðŸš€ Features

- ðŸ”„ **Switch between classification and regression**
- ðŸ§  **Trains multiple ML models automatically**
  - Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, etc.
- ðŸ“ˆ **Performance metrics and visual comparison**
- ðŸ”® **Real-time prediction** from user input
- ðŸ“Š **Beautiful visualizations** (accuracy, precision, RÂ², MAE)
- ðŸ§© Easy to use Gradio UI

## ðŸ§ª Dataset Info

The dataset should include the following water quality features:

- `pH`, `EC`, `CO3`, `HCO3`, `Cl`, `SO4`, `NO3`, `TH`, `Ca`, `Mg`, `Na`, `K`, `F`, `TDS`

Target columns:
- `Water Quality Classification` (for classification)
- `WQI` (for regression)

> ðŸ—‚ Place your `DataSet.csv` in the root directory or adjust the path in `app.py`.
